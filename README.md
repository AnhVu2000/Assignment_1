# Anh's Profile

## Personal Information
My name is Anh Vu. My student number is 3722322 and my email is s3722322@student.rmit.edu.au
I was born in Australia but my parents are from Vietnam so I speak both Vietnamese and English. I have completed VCE and a certificate III in Information Technology.

I love all kinds of animals but my favourite type would definitely be cats. I have a black and white energetic kitten named Sushi who loves to be around people just like me. In my spare time I enjoy playing games including osu and overwatch with my friends when we can all relax and share a laugh. I would also describe myself as a creative and cheerful person who loves to make art through drawing and sewing. I love learning about the world from different perspectives through documentaries, biographies and books.  

## Interest in I.T
My interest started around year 11 when teachers encouraged us to have a course goal we wanted to work towards. They organised sessions with a career counsellor for us to discuss which types of jobs would be suitable for our personalities and interests. After I received advice about courses I might enjoy I attended open days to expose myself to the many career and course opportunities available. I was able to meet current students who could share their own personal experience in the course and answer any questions I was curious about. 

My cousins and uncles mainly work in the I.T industry so they were able to provide further advice and an insight into different branches of the course. I was encouraged to have an open mind when learning about the many streams within the industry and to continue They motivated me to explore my interest in I.T by attending information sessions and eventually enrolling in I.T RMIT.

I chose to enrol in RMIT because it is internationally recognised for its academic excellence. RMIT provides students with many resources and events that allow them to network with professionals and expand their skills. The university provides quality education and offers students a chance to study abroad in Vietnam. The opportunity to be able to study overseas would assist in my own personal development by experiencing life in another culture.
