# Anh's Profile

## Personal Information
My name is Anh Vu. My student number is x and my email is x I was born in Australia but my parents are from Vietnam so I speak both Vietnamese and English. I have completed VCE and a certificate III in Information Technology.

I love all kinds of animals but my favourite type would definitely be cats. I have a black and white energetic kitten named Sushi who loves to be around people just like me. In my spare time I enjoy playing games including osu and overwatch with my friends when we can all relax and share a laugh. I would also describe myself as a creative and cheerful person who loves to make art through drawing and sewing. I love learning about the world from different perspectives through documentaries, biographies and books.
