# Anh's Profile

## Personal Information
My name is Anh Vu. My student number is 3722322 and my email is s3722322@student.rmit.edu.au  
I was born in Australia but my parents are from Vietnam so I speak both Vietnamese and English. I have completed VCE and a certificate III in Information Technology.

I love all kinds of animals but my favourite type would definitely be cats. I have a black and white energetic kitten named Sushi who loves to be around people just like me. In my spare time I enjoy playing games including osu and overwatch with my friends when we can all relax and share a laugh. I would also describe myself as a creative and cheerful person who loves to make art through drawing and sewing. I love learning about the world from different perspectives through documentaries, biographies and books.  

## Interest in I.T
I have not had much experience in I.T yet but I am currently enjoying the programming aspect of the course. It is quite difficult however I love challenging myself and finding different ways to solve a problem. I also have an interest in learning about mobile computing as I believe it is an essential skill to be able to understand the mobile technologies in the rapidly evolving I.T industry. I am interested in learning more about the software behind programs as I find it fascinating when understanding how applications function.

My interest started around year 11 when teachers encouraged us to have an idea of the course we wanted to work towards during VCE. They organised sessions with a career counsellor for us to discuss which types of jobs would be suitable for our personalities and interests. After I received advice about courses I might enjoy I attended open days to expose myself to the many career and course opportunities available. I was able to meet current students who could share their own personal experiences in the course and answer any questions I was curious about. 

My cousins and uncles mainly work in the I.T industry so they were able to provide further advice and an insight into different branches of the course. I was encouraged to keep an open mind when learning about the many streams within the industry and to seek out further information on my own. This was to ensure that if I pursued my interest in I.T, I would be making a decision I was passionate about. They motivated me to explore my options by attending information sessions and eventually enrolling in I.T RMIT.

I chose to enrol in RMIT because it is internationally recognised for its academic excellence. RMIT provides students with many resources and events that allow them to network with professionals and expand their skills. The university provides quality education and offers students a chance to study abroad in Vietnam. The opportunity to be able to study overseas would assist in my own personal development by experiencing life in another culture.

During my studies I expect to broaden my knowledge about the I.T industry and learn in depth the hardware and software involved in various program applications. RMIT would further provide me with useful skills to assist in my approach to solving problems within a code. I would also understand the various course options I can specialise in to provide me with a better idea of the type of job I wish to pursue after university.

[My Ideal Job](https://www.seek.com.au/job/35590959?type=standout&userqueryid=59ee92bd6113229f7bd7b9d8ca683bde-7150092)

The job involves being the main person who provides I.T support for the employees as well as the company Toyota Financial Services. It includes following the appropriate company agreements whilst thoroughly documenting enquiries to record the details of an issue and ways to resolve it. The position appeals to me as it involves communicating with employees and customers to ensure they receive the I.T related help they need. I enjoy solving both simple and complex problems and through this job it would introduce me to range of different I.T issues and allow me to discover new ways in my approach to interpreting them. 

My current qualifications include completing a certificate III in Information Technology

## Personal Profile
To me these tests emphasise that I am strongly introverted. I am self-aware and rather than being impulsive I think of the potential outcomes before forming a decision. Although I tend to observe and think rather than openly discussing my perspective, I am confident in expressing my opinions when I feel the need to. I have an inquisitive mind and prefer exploring new opportunities over following a definite plan. There may be a bit of difficulty with aural learning but I am a strong learner through reading and writing. 

Within a team I may be reserved in the beginning as I listen to my teammates ideas and form my own opinions. After considering their ideas I would be open to discussing any adjustments and other possible improvements. 

## Project Ideas
### Overview
My project idea is a device that would be able to water the garden on its own without requiring people holding a hose to water each plant. It would be similar to a drone but fly over the garden in a programmed pattern instead of having humans physically holding a control to direct it . Instead of using multiple sprinklers where they only cover a certain area, one drone would be sufficient enough to be able to reach all parts of the garden. It can also be programmed to automatically turn on and off to water the plants at a certain time.

### Motivation
The project will be extremely useful for many home-owners as they may not have the time to water their garden themselves or not have enough energy to do so. By having a device that waters the garden itself, many would be more likely to care for it as they do not need to physically water each plant. Majority of homeowners have a garden therefore there is a large population that the device would be advertised to. Although each garden has varying layouts, the device can be individually programmed to suit the userâ€™s needs and landscape.
